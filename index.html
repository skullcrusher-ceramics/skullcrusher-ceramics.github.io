          <p>My work explores the relationship between acquired synesthesia and emotional memories.</p>

          <p>With influences as diverse as Caravaggio and John Lennon, new synergies are generated from both opaque and transparent layers.</p>

          <p>Ever since I was a postgraduate I have been fascinated by the traditional understanding of the human condition. What starts out as contemplation soon becomes debased into a hegemony of lust, leaving only a sense of unreality and the inevitability of a new beginning.</p>

          <p>As wavering derivatives become frozen through studious and repetitive practice, the viewer is left with an insight into the inaccuracies of our era.</p>

          <p>My work explores the relationship between Critical theory and copycat violence.</p>

          <p>With influences as diverse as Nietzsche and Miles Davis, new insights are generated from both simple and complex narratives.</p>

          <p>Ever since I was a child I have been fascinated by the theoretical limits of the mind. What starts out as triumph soon becomes manipulated into a dialectic of defeat, leaving only a sense of decadence and the possibility of a new understanding.</p>

          <p>As momentary derivatives become transformed through frantic and academic practice, the viewer is left with a tribute to the inaccuracies of our era.</p>

          <p>My work explores the relationship between Jungian archetypes and multimedia experiences.</p>

          <p>With influences as diverse as Rousseau and Andy Warhol, new combinations are manufactured from both simple and complex meanings.</p>

          <p>Ever since I was a postgraduate I have been fascinated by the ephemeral nature of the zeitgeist. What starts out as contemplation soon becomes manipulated into a manifesto of defeat, leaving only a sense of decadence and the possibility of a new reality.</p>

          <p>As wavering derivatives become transformed through emergent and diverse practice, the viewer is left with an epitaph for the outposts of our culture.</p>

          <p>My work explores the relationship between the Military-Industrial Complex and counter-terrorism.</p>

          <p>With influences as diverse as Machiavelli and Miles Davis, new combinations are distilled from both constructed and discovered layers.</p>

          <p>Ever since I was a student I have been fascinated by the unrelenting divergence of the zeitgeist. What starts out as vision soon becomes corrupted into a tragedy of greed, leaving only a sense of nihilism and the prospect of a new reality.</p>

          <p>As wavering derivatives become clarified through studious and critical practice, the viewer is left with a hymn to the limits of our culture.</p>

          <p>With influences as diverse as Kierkegaard and John Lennon, new variations are crafted from both constructed and discovered dialogues.</p>

          <p>Ever since I was a postgraduate I have been fascinated by the endless oscillation of the moment. What starts out as yearning soon becomes corrupted into a carnival of lust, leaving only a sense of what could have been and the chance of a new order.</p>
